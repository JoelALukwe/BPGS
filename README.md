**Date:** 29 September ‚Äì 3 October  
**Compiled by:** Joel Alukwe

## üìò Overview
Week 7 of the **Bioinformatics for Pathogen Genomic Surveillance** program provided a comprehensive introduction to computational genomics and evolutionary analysis as applied to infectious disease surveillance. Participants were introduced to R for data handling and visualization, learned the full workflow from raw sequencing reads to submission-ready genomic data, and explored how molecular evolution and phylogenetic tools inform public health responses.

---

## üß™ Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to R Programming  
- From Sequencing to Data Preparation  
- Data Submission Workflows (GISAID and SRA)  
- Introduction to Genomic Epidemiology  
- Sequence Classification and Public Tools  
- Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution  
- Constructing a Reference Dataset  
- Sequence Alignment (Pairwise and Multiple)  
- Phylogenetic Inference & Practical  
- Ancestral State Reconstruction  
- BEAST Lecture & Practical  
- Data Visualization
